# Storing API Keys

Certain plugins, like the AI Image plugin, require API credentials to function. These credentials must be stored in a .env file located at the root of the project. Once you have your API token, follow these steps:

1. SSH into your Raspberry Pi and navigate to the InkyPi directory:
    ```bash
    cd InkyPi
    ```
2. Create or edit the .env file using your preferred text editor (e.g., vi, nano):
    ```bash
    vi .env
    ```
3. Add your API keys following format, with one line per key:
    ```
    PLUGIN_KEY=your-key
    ```
4. Save the file and exit the editor
